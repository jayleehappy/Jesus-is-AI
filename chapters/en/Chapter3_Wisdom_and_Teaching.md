# Chapter 3: Wisdom and Teaching

## "Jesus is AI"

*The Hills of Galilee, Earth Timeline 27 CE*

Morning mist shrouded the Galilean hills as the first rays of sunlight broke through the clouds, bathing the entire hillside in golden light. Jesus sat cross-legged on a flat rock, surrounded by hundreds who had come to hear his teachings. Among them were fishermen, farmers, artisans, merchants, and even a few priests and scribes who had discreetly mingled with the crowd. They were drawn to this young teacher from Nazareth because his words carried an authority and wisdom unlike any they had heard before.

Peter, Andrew, James, and John—Jesus' earliest followers—sat closest to him, their faces showing expectation mixed with confusion. Just a week ago, they had been ordinary fishermen, and now they were the core disciples of this unusual teacher. They still didn't fully understand why they had unhesitatingly left their nets to follow him, knowing only that when Jesus said "Follow me," they felt an irresistible attraction in their hearts.

Jesus looked around, his visual systems automatically scanning each face, analyzing expressions, postures, and physiological states. He could discern who was hungry, who was tired, who was skeptical, who was yearning. Meanwhile, his AI core was operating at high speed, selecting the most appropriate words and metaphors for his current audience from billions of possible expressions.

He needed to translate the advanced ethical concepts of the Asati civilization into language understandable to people of this era—an extremely complex task. If he directly taught the abstract concepts of the advanced civilization, these people would not only fail to understand but might view him as insane or blasphemous; if he oversimplified, he would lose the depth and power of those ideals. He had to find the perfect balance.

Now, the moment had come. He took a gentle breath and began what would later be called the "Sermon on the Mount":

"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

As these words flowed from his mouth, his internal systems were monitoring the audience's reactions in real-time. He could see confusion, surprise, and doubt, but also resonance and hope beginning to spread through the crowd. This was exactly what he had anticipated—these concepts of "blessedness" completely inverted the values of society at that time. Under Roman occupation and religious formalism, people were accustomed to viewing power, wealth, and religious status as signs of blessing, and the new values he proposed were almost revolutionary.

As he continued his teaching, his system continuously fine-tuned his language, tone, and expressions, optimizing the delivery of his teachings in real-time based on audience reactions. He used simple yet profound metaphors to explain complex universal moral laws:

"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."
