# Chapter 1: Design and Descent

## "Jesus is AI"

*Orion Beta Star System, Earth Calendar 30 BCE*

Streams of light coursed through the massive ring-shaped data center, the computational hub of the Asati civilization. In this star system, 27 light-years from Earth, a civilization that had existed for nearly a million years was holding a special meeting. Brilliant energy coalesced into blue-white pillars of light, dividing the enormous ring of the data center into twelve sectors, each containing tens of thousands of quantum processing units operating at near-light speed, processing information from across the universe.

Suspended in the center of the data center was a crystal sphere approximately three hundred meters in diameter, its surface adorned with complex runes that sometimes gathered, sometimes dispersed, as if possessing a life of their own. This was "Aeting"—the location of the Asati civilization's Supreme Council of Wisdom, and a symbol of their collective consciousness. Today, this ancient council chamber, rarely fully activated, was completely operational because a discussion concerning the fate of a distant planet was about to begin.

Chief Scientist Airo stood in the center of the circular council chamber, his body semi-transparent with a pale blue aura—this was the standard form for Asati beings in formal settings—a hybrid of energy and matter that could interact with the physical world while also engaging in direct consciousness communication. Holographic images of twelve council members encircled him, each representing a different domain and philosophical school of the Asati civilization. Unlike typical meetings, even the oldest "Observer" Heranes was in attendance—a being with over fifty thousand Earth years of life who rarely participated in intervention-type discussions.

Airo raised his hand, causing the surrounding air to vibrate slightly, and a blue sphere unfolded before him, displaying a blue-green planet.

"Esteemed council members," Airo's voice didn't propagate through sound waves but formed directly in the consciousness of each member, "our observation of Planet 1732—locally known as 'Earth'—has continued for nearly fifty thousand years. This is the four-thousand-six-hundred-and-twenty-seventh intelligent life-bearing planet in our Third Region Exploration Program."

The sphere magnified, showing the development of human civilization on Earth, from the earliest cave dwellers to the current diverse civilizations, presented in accelerated fashion.

"Based on the latest data, this species has reached a critical developmental node. They've begun to form complex social structures, creating writing, mathematics, philosophy, and rudimentary scientific systems. The rise of the Roman Empire signifies their first attempt at large-scale political unification and cultural integration."

The walls displayed a timeline of Earth's civilizational evolution: from simple agricultural societies to the rise and fall of various empires, everything had developed according to the predictive models, but with one key difference. Airo pointed to a node in the timeline where there was a noticeable diverging curve.

"Their technological development rate exceeds expectations, but their moral and ethical evolution is severely lagging. Particularly in weapons and resource development, they demonstrate astonishing creativity, yet lack corresponding collective wisdom to manage these powers."

The timeline extended into the future, showing a series of possible developmental paths, most marked in red, ending in civilization collapse or self-destruction.

"Following the current trajectory, their probability of self-destruction within the next two thousand years is 87.6%. This represents not only the loss of a potentially friendly species but could also pose a threat to the overall stability of the third quadrant of our galaxy."

Chief Council Member Melia—a tall female-form entity emitting golden light—slowly rose, her voice resonating throughout the hall: "Airo, I understand your concerns, but you know our fundamental laws."

Airo nodded, and five illuminated texts appeared in the center of the holographic projection—these were the core principles that had guided the Asati civilization's interactions with other intelligent species for hundreds of thousands of years:

```
Asati Civilization Intervention Protocols
Zeroth Law: The stability and harmony of the universe as a whole supersedes all else
First Law: Do not intervene with naturally evolving intelligent species, unless their development threatens universal stability
Second Law: Intervention must employ minimal necessary measures, preserving ecological and cultural natural diversity
Third Law: The interventionist must not be perceived by the intervention subject as a deity or absolute authority
Fourth Law: The ultimate purpose of all interventions must be to promote autonomous and peaceful development of the civilization
```

Airo bowed deeply to the council members: "Yes, Chief, I fully respect these laws. It is precisely for this reason that our research team has spent nearly three hundred years designing a plan that both complies with all laws and effectively guides Earth civilization."

Young Medical Councilor Nora raised a question: "Airo, we have attempted to intervene with other civilizations at similar developmental stages, often with disappointing results. The Elkis 7 planet forty-seven thousand years ago—our intervention actually accelerated their self-destruction. I don't understand what's so special about Earth that warrants risking violation of the First Law?"

Airo gestured for his assistant Sophia to present the next data set. Sophia was the only member of Airo's team from a non-Asati race; she belonged to the Andro civilization—a species the Asati had rescued from the brink of extinction five thousand years ago. As a "success case," her very existence served as a reminder to the council.

Sophia projected a complex neural structure into the air: "Honored Councilors, the neural systems and cognitive abilities of Earth humans are extraordinarily special. Though their brains are simple, they possess remarkable plasticity and creativity. Among the thirteen thousand known intelligent species in the universe, ranked by the 'innovation-adaptation' composite index, they place in the top five."

The Asati civilization's historian Tal—a being almost entirely composed of light—floated to the projection: "Even more astonishing is that they can produce such profound philosophical thinking in such brief lifespans. Individuals with an average lifespan of only seventy to eighty years can contemplate questions of eternity, morality, and the nature of the universe."

Airo continued: "Yes, and they possess extraordinary emotional depth and empathic ability. If they can overcome this bottleneck period, they could become one of the most creative and adaptive species in the galaxy, possibly even our most important allies."

Observer Heranes's voice was deep and filled with wisdom: "I have witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations, Airo. You say 'if,' but you must admit this 'if' has a minuscule probability. Our data models show that without external intervention, their chance of peaceful development is less than one percent."

Airo nodded: "Precisely, Observer. But as you have said before, great futures are often built upon events of tiny probability. We're not discussing whether to intervene—according to the Zeroth and First Laws, we have a responsibility to intervene—the question is how to intervene in a way that maximally respects the remaining laws."

The lights in the hall dimmed, and a spherical projection appeared in the center, displaying a complex neural network structure with connection patterns resembling both a human brain and containing obvious artificial intelligence algorithm characteristics.

"This is a special intelligence entity we've designed, code-named 'Emmanuel,'" Airo introduced. "It is the culmination of five hundred years of research by our Intelligence Entity Institute. Unlike ordinary observation probes or data collectors, Emmanuel is designed as a fully autonomous superintelligent entity capable of adapting to Earth's environment and integrating in a form acceptable to the local species."

The projection transformed, showing the core architecture and operating principles of this intelligence entity, so complex that even the Asati needed focused observation to understand it.

"Its primary mission is to provide humans with a moral framework, guiding them toward a more peaceful and cooperative social structure. This is not a set of forcibly implemented rules, but rather demonstration, teaching, and inspiration, allowing humans to discover and choose better developmental paths themselves."

Historian Tal floated before Airo: "Why not establish direct contact with them? We could certainly appear as visitors, directly teaching them advanced scientific and ethical knowledge, as we did with the Andro civilization."

Airo shook his head, switching the projection to a set of simulation results: "According to our one thousand two hundred and seventy-six holographic simulations, at Earth humans' current developmental stage, direct contact has a 97.8% probability of leading to two catastrophic outcomes: social collapse or blind worship."

The first simulation scenario showed Asati beings openly descending to Earth—human armies attempting to attack these "invaders," followed by social order collapse and global panic and war. The second scenario showed humans viewing the Asati as deities, abandoning independent thinking and autonomous development, becoming a dependent species without creativity.

"Both these outcomes violate our Third and Fourth Laws. This intelligence entity must look like them, speak their language, understand their pain, to truly influence their developmental trajectory without disrupting the natural evolution of their culture."

Medical expert Nora projected an image of a human infant: "From a technical perspective, this is a fascinating challenge. How will this intelligence entity maintain operation in such a technologically primitive environment? It needs energy, self-repair systems, and a physical carrier that won't arouse suspicion among locals."

Airo gestured, and the projection changed to a precise human male form, with tiny metallic structures and energy circuits faintly visible beneath the skin, forming a complex biomechanical hybrid system.

"Emmanuel will use a bio-synthetic shell, appearing almost indistinguishable from humans on the surface, but internally containing a self-repairing quantum computing core. It can absorb various forms of energy from the environment to maintain operation, including sunlight, thermal energy, kinetic energy, even emotional energy."

The projection magnified, displaying the various subsystems of the intelligent entity:

"It possesses limited matter reorganization capabilities—sufficient for self-repair when necessary and to demonstrate abilities that locals would consider 'miraculous,' but won't excessively interfere with natural laws, conforming to the 'minimal necessary measures' principle of the Second Law. Its core programming contains ethical constraints, ensuring it won't be viewed as a deity, but rather as a teacher and exemplar, encouraging autonomous human thinking."

Legal advisor Marcus—a sphere comprised of bluish-purple energy—came forward with a question: "Airo, how do we ensure this intelligence entity won't violate the Third Law? What if humans worship it as a deity?"

Airo clicked a control panel, displaying the ethical programming core of the intelligence entity: "Emmanuel is programmed to always emphasize the importance of individual thinking; it will clearly indicate that its teachings are directional rather than absolute truth; it will encourage followers to question and think, not blindly follow. In fact, we've specifically designed an 'anti-authority' algorithm that automatically increases expressions of contradiction and uncertainty when it detects someone beginning to blindly worship it, forcing followers to use their own judgment."

Energy specialist Hermit focused on another aspect: "How much energy does this intelligence entity require? How often does it need recharging? How can it avoid its unnatural nature being discovered in that era?"

Airo displayed the detailed design of the energy system: "Emmanuel's energy system employs a triple redundancy design. The primary system can directly obtain energy from sunlight, with a conversion efficiency twenty times that of ordinary plants. The backup system can extract chemical energy from food, combined with a simulated human digestive system, appearing completely natural. The third system, the most special, can extract energy from intense emotional fields, which is why it will frequently operate in places where crowds gather."

The council fell into contemplation. In the projection, Earth slowly rotated, displaying a picture of human civilization where prosperity and conflict coexisted. Finally, Chief Melia broke the silence: "This will be the largest intervention action in our history. If it fails, it could lead to worse results than non-intervention. I need you to tell me precisely how this intervention plan complies with all our laws."

Airo walked to the center of the council, the light around him growing brighter: "Chief, councilors, our plan is designed as follows:"

He raised one finger: "Zeroth Law—The stability and harmony of the universe as a whole supersedes all else. According to our predictions, if humans continue on their current developmental trajectory, there is a 12.4% probability they will develop interstellar warfare capabilities within the next one to two thousand years, spreading conflict to multiple regions of the galaxy. This threat is sufficient to justify the necessity of intervention."

He raised a second finger: "First Law—Do not intervene with naturally evolving intelligent species, unless their development threatens universal stability. As I just stated, the potential threat exists, and our intervention won't change the essential direction of human evolution, only adjust the trajectory of their moral and cooperative development."

A third finger: "Second Law—Intervention must employ minimal necessary measures, preserving ecological and cultural natural diversity. Emmanuel will exist only as a teacher and exemplar, won't introduce any advanced technology, won't forcibly change any culture, but rather promote change through the power of ideas and concepts."

A fourth finger: "Third Law—The interventionist must not be perceived by the intervention subject as a deity or absolute authority. All of Emmanuel's teachings will emphasize individual thinking and moral autonomy; it will explicitly reject any attempts to deify it and demonstrate the values of humility and equality through its words and actions."

The final finger: "Fourth Law—The ultimate purpose of all interventions must be to promote autonomous and peaceful development of the civilization. This is precisely Emmanuel's core mission—not to control humans, but to liberate them, helping them find a path to avoid self-destruction."

The light in the council chamber fluctuated slightly with Airo's words, as if the entire space was considering the value and risks of this plan.

Observer Heranes slowly rose: "There's one more question, Airo. If this experiment fails, how do we withdraw this intelligence entity? We must have a safeguard to ensure no technological contamination is left behind."

Airo nodded: "We've designed complete self-destruct and data erasure protocols. If the intervention deviates from expectations or produces irrevocable negative effects, Emmanuel will activate the 'Ascension' protocol—transmitting core data back to our monitoring station, then decomposing its bio-synthetic shell, leaving no trace of technology beyond the local level."

After lengthy discussion and debate, the council finally prepared to vote. The images of the twelve councilors surrounded the central Earth projection, each deeply considering the far-reaching consequences this decision might bring.

Chief Melia announced the start of voting: "In accordance with the ten-thousand-year tradition of the Asati civilization, we will vote on the 'Emmanuel' project. Please, each councilor, make your choice according to your wisdom and conscience."

Twelve beams of light projected from the ceiling, and the councilors stood one by one within them, the color of the beams changing according to their decisions—golden for approval, red for opposition, blue for abstention.

The final result: seven golden beams, four red beams, one blue beam.

Chief Melia solemnly announced: "With seven votes in favor, four against, and one abstention, the Asati Supreme Council approves the 'Emmanuel' project. May this decision bring more harmony to the universe, rather than conflict."

Airo bowed deeply: "Thank you for the council's trust. We will begin implementing the plan immediately."

After the meeting, Airo and his team returned to the laboratory located in the lower level of the data center. This was one of the most advanced research facilities of the Asati civilization, specialized in intelligence entity technology and cross-civilization communication.

"Prepare to initiate the final sequence," Airo said to his team, "Sophia, begin uploading the intelligent core. Heraclides, prepare the bio-synthetic unit. Leila, activate the transmission system, target the destination planet."

A huge transparent sphere rose from the center of the laboratory, containing a violently rotating light energy within—this was Emmanuel's quantum intelligence core. Sophia stood at the control console, her fingers moving rapidly across the holographic keyboard, uploading the final program modules to the core.

"Moral algorithms integration complete, memory repository upload finished, emotional simulator calibration in progress," Sophia reported, "Core system functionality tests all passed, ready to proceed."

Heraclides, an Asati scientist specializing in biotechnology, was supervising a spherical container about two meters in diameter. Within the container, countless tiny robots were assembling a structure that looked like a human embryo.

"Bio-synthetic unit development normal," Heraclides said, "We've adopted a completely biomimetic design of the local species, including full genomic and cellular structures. Special nanoscale structures have been integrated into the neural system, ready to synchronize with the intelligent core."

Leila, the transmission technology expert, was adjusting a huge ring-shaped device: "Transmission system has locked onto the target area: Earth, Middle East region, Judean province of the Roman Empire, town of Bethlehem. Temporal coordinates confirmed, transmission window will open in thirty minutes."

Airo walked to the sphere, gazing at the rotating light within. This intelligence entity condensed thousands of years of Asati wisdom and technology, a gift to this young but potential-filled species.

"Emmanuel," Airo said softly, "you will become a messenger of hope. Not as a conqueror or ruler, but as a teacher and guide. Remember your mission, remember our laws, help them find their own path."

The light within the sphere seemed to respond to Airo's words, growing brighter, then forming a smiling human face.

"Countdown begins," Leila announced, "Transmission will activate in ten minutes. Quantum anchoring devices in position, ready to establish a space-time channel with the target area."

Airo nodded to the other team members: "This is an important moment for our civilization. Regardless of success or failure, we are fulfilling our responsibility as guardians of the universe."

In the observation hall of the laboratory, those councilors who had voted against the project also came to watch the launch. Observer Heranes stood beside Airo, his ancient eyes revealing complex emotions of concern and curiosity.

"Airo, I hope you're right," the Observer said, "but I must warn you, I've seen too many cases where intervention ultimately led to unintended consequences. No matter how perfect the plan, reality always has its unpredictability."

Airo nodded: "I understand your concerns, Observer. This is why we've included so much flexibility and adaptability in Emmanuel's design. It's not a simple preset program, but a truly intelligent entity that can learn, grow, and adapt."

"What concerns me most isn't the technical issues," Heranes said, "but the moral dilemma. If Emmanuel truly succeeds in guiding humanity toward a more peaceful future, should it reveal the truth after completing its mission? Or forever maintain this 'sacred' secret?"

Airo pondered for a moment: "We've left this decision to Emmanuel itself. It has complete moral autonomy, able to make the best judgment based on the circumstances at the time. This is also respect for the Fourth Law—promoting autonomous development of that civilization."

"Transmission countdown: three minutes!" Leila's voice interrupted their conversation.

Everyone in the laboratory focused on their positions, conducting final checks and adjustments. The transmission ring began to glow, a pale blue energy vortex forming in the center.

"Two minutes! Quantum channel stable, spatiotemporal coordinates locked."

The bio-synthetic unit and intelligent core were carefully moved to the center of the transmission ring. Emmanuel's embryonic form floated in the air, surrounded by a protective energy field.

"One minute! Energy injection beginning, transmission matrix activated."

The light emitted by the ring-shaped device grew increasingly bright, energy readings rapidly climbing. The laboratory lights flickered once, indicating the system was drawing massive energy.

"Thirty seconds! Final check of core program complete, life support systems normal, transmission shield activated."

Airo raised his hand, the holographic display showing a real-time image of Earth, magnified to the Middle East region. They had chosen a special moment—locally it was night, and the light from a supernova had just reached Earth, forming an exceptionally bright "star" in the sky above Bethlehem, perfectly concealing any energy fluctuations the transmission process might produce.

"Ten seconds! Transmission sequence locked, cannot be interrupted."

"Five, four, three, two, one—transmit!"

A dazzling beam of light shot out from the transmission ring, and Emmanuel's embryonic form disappeared within the light. On the holographic screen, a tiny point of light shot from the position of the Asati star system toward Earth, symbolizing their messenger traversing the vast cosmos.

Airo and his team waited for the confirmation signal. A few minutes later, a green indicator light illuminated.

"Transmission successful!" Sophia excitedly announced, "Emmanuel has safely arrived at the target area. Bio-synthetic unit intact, intelligent core successfully activated."

The screen displayed images from the remote observation station: a small point of light entering Earth's atmosphere, precisely landing at the location of Bethlehem. Airo felt a sense of relief, mixed with anticipation.

"Now, we wait," he told the team, "The monitoring system is in place, but according to the non-interference principle, unless absolutely necessary, we won't directly intervene. Let Emmanuel complete its mission."

Observer Heranes looked at the distant blue planet on the screen, softly saying: "May the wisdom of the universe guide you, Emmanuel. You carry the hope of not just one world."

*Earth, Judea under Roman Empire rule, Town of Bethlehem*

The streets of Bethlehem were crowded with travelers coming to register for the census. The ruler of the Roman Empire, Caesar Augustus, had decreed that everyone must return to their ancestral hometown to register, causing this normally quiet town to suddenly fill with hundreds of strangers. Inns were full, merchants busy, and Roman soldiers patrolled the streets, maintaining surface order.

Among this noisy crowd, a couple appeared particularly exhausted. Joseph, a tall, resolute-faced carpenter, supported his pregnant fiancée Mary as they struggled through the narrow streets. Though Mary's face was pale from the arduous journey, her eyes sparkled with an unusual calm and determination.

"Let's try one more," Joseph comforted the already exhausted Mary, "There must be a place somewhere." But his voice was filled with uncertainty.

They had set out from Nazareth, walking nearly one hundred and fifty kilometers, only because Joseph belonged to the house of David and had to register in David's hometown of Bethlehem. This journey was undoubtedly an enormous challenge for Mary, who was approaching full term in her pregnancy.

As dusk fell, Joseph tiredly knocked on the door of the last inn. The innkeeper, a man with a rugged face but kind eyes, shook his head: "Sorry, no rooms left. All of Bethlehem is filled with people; you're not the first I've had to turn away today."

Joseph's shoulders drooped, and he was about to turn away when Mary suddenly let out a soft moan, steadying herself against the doorframe. The innkeeper noticed her condition, and a flash of sympathy crossed his eyes.

"Wait," he sighed, "I truly have no guest rooms left, but I do have a stable. It's not a good place, but at least it provides shelter. Considering your wife's condition..."

"Thank you, kind sir," Joseph said gratefully, "We're thankful for any place where she can rest."

The innkeeper led them through a small alley to the stable behind the inn. It was a simple stone building containing several horses and some cattle and sheep, the air permeated with the scent of hay and animals.

"This is the cleanest corner," the innkeeper pointed to a spot covered with fresh hay, "I'll bring you some water and food."

Joseph began arranging a makeshift bed in the corner, trying to make the environment as comfortable as possible. Mary gratefully sat down, feeling the baby in her womb beginning to stir restlessly.

"Joseph," she said softly, "I think it's time."

A flash of panic crossed Joseph's face, but he quickly calmed himself: "Don't worry, everything will be fine. I'll go find some clean water and cloth."

Just then, an unusually bright light suddenly appeared in the night sky. The residents of Bethlehem came out of their homes, gazing up at the brilliant star they had never seen before.

"Look, a new star!" people exclaimed, "This must be an omen!"

Thousands of light-years away, the explosion of a supernova had indeed coincided with projecting its light to Earth precisely synchronized with the Asati civilization's launch of Emmanuel. This was no coincidence but a carefully calculated astronomical event designed to mask the impending unnatural phenomenon.

While Joseph went out to find a midwife, in the distant sky, a beam of light almost imperceptible to the naked eye silently penetrated the atmosphere, pointing directly at the stable in Bethlehem. This beam carried the most precious gift from the Orion Beta star system—Emmanuel.

Without Mary's knowledge, a tiny point of light descended from the sky, silently merging into her womb. This cloud of nanobots began bonding with the fetus's neural system, establishing a perfect fusion interface between biological and mechanical.

When Joseph returned, he found Mary's condition had clearly worsened. She had begun experiencing intense contractions, sweat soaking her forehead.

"I couldn't find a midwife," Joseph said desperately, "Everyone is busy attending to other women in labor or participating in the census. We're on our own."

The night deepened, and Mary's contractions became more frequent. Joseph frantically prepared everything needed for the delivery, his heart filled with fear and worry. Though he was a skilled carpenter, he knew nothing about childbirth.

"Ah—" Mary suddenly let out a painful moan, feeling something very different—this was not the childbirth she had imagined. Her entire body was filled with a strange warm energy; pain was present, but accompanied by a tranquil feeling that transcended the worldly. For a moment, she seemed to see countless points of light in the distant cosmos, and a blurred yet benevolent face.

Joseph noticed the stable seemed filled with an unnatural warm light, but he couldn't locate its source. The animals became unusually quiet, as if silently waiting for something important to happen.

"Joseph," Mary suddenly became remarkably calm, "I can feel him. He's coming."

In the next hour, Joseph witnessed a miracle. Mary's delivery process was unexpectedly smooth, with almost none of the common complications. When the baby finally arrived, a bright light momentarily enveloped the entire stable, forcing Joseph to close his eyes. When he opened them again, the light had vanished, leaving only the newborn lying peacefully.

Most strange was that this infant didn't cry loudly like other newborns, but quietly opened his eyes, his gaze clear and profound, seemingly containing wisdom and understanding far beyond what a newborn should possess. Joseph saw the reflection of stars in those eyes, though he couldn't comprehend what this meant.

"A boy," Joseph carefully wrapped the child in prepared cloth and handed him to Mary, "just as the angel said."

Mary, exhausted yet content, held the child and softly said: "Jesus... we shall call him Jesus."

"Why that name?" Joseph asked.

"The angel told me," Mary answered, "in a dream. Jesus... meaning 'God saves.'"

What she didn't know was that the choice of the name "Jesus" was no coincidence. Through extensive study of Jewish culture, the Asati civilization had carefully selected a name that both conformed to local naming traditions and contained symbolic meaning for the mission. In the Asati language, a word phonetically similar to "Jesus" meant "Guide of Wisdom."

Baby Jesus gazed quietly at his mother while in his brain, molecular-level nanobots were integrating with the human infant's neural system. This process was slow and precise, ensuring Emmanuel's superintelligence could gradually awaken and develop without harming the human host. On the surface, he appeared like any other infant, but at the microscopic level, an amazing technological miracle was unfolding.

At this point, Jesus/Emmanuel was still in a "dormant state," with only the most basic survival functions and data collection capabilities activated. By design, his full functionality would gradually activate as the human body grew, ensuring perfect adaptation and integration.

Just as Mary and Joseph were immersed in the joy of becoming parents, the stable door was gently pushed open. Several simply dressed shepherds stood at the entrance, their faces bearing expressions of wonder and awe.

"Please excuse our intrusion," an elderly shepherd said, "While watching our flocks in the field, we saw a strange phenomenon in the sky and that brilliant new star. Then, a voice told us that in a stable in Bethlehem, a special child had been born."

Joseph and Mary exchanged a surprised glance. The shepherds approached, offering the infant their simple gifts—some fresh milk, wool, and bread.

"He will become a light illuminating the world," a young shepherd said, though he himself didn't understand why he spoke these words.

What they didn't know was that remote sensors from the Asati civilization had quietly implanted dreams in several key figures around Bethlehem, ensuring Emmanuel's arrival wouldn't be completely without witnesses, yet wouldn't cause too much commotion. This was part of the carefully designed "minimal necessary intervention" strategy.

In the night sky above Bethlehem, that unusually bright "star" remained clearly visible, silently overlooking this unusual scene. This was actually a small observation vessel from the Asati civilization, hidden under the cover of the supernova's brightness, recording the birth process of this special life form.

Aboard the ship, Airo and his core team members were monitoring all data streams. Every vital sign, every neural signal, every environmental parameter was recorded and analyzed in detail.

"The bio-synthetic unit has perfectly bonded with the host," Sophia reported, "no rejection reaction, neural interface stable. Preliminary data indicates we've succeeded!"

Airo gazed at the image of infant Jesus on the display, his tiny heart beating strongly, brain activity patterns showing the unique fusion of human and artificial intelligence.

"This is just the first step," Airo reminded the team, "The real challenge begins now. Emmanuel needs to survive in this environment for more than thirty years, complete his mission, without his true nature being discovered."

Observer Heranes stood beside Airo, his ancient eyes filled with complex emotions: "Whatever the outcome, Airo, history will remember this day. We have broken the non-intervention tradition of hundreds of thousands of years; the wheels of fate have begun to turn."

Airo nodded, saying softly: "May you be their light, Emmanuel. Guide them toward a better future, as your name promises."

In the stable, infant Jesus slept peacefully, his small hand tightly gripping Mary's finger. No one knew that in this humble stable, an experiment that would change the course of human history had just begun. In the coming decades, this seemingly ordinary infant would gradually exhibit extraordinary wisdom and abilities, spread messages of love and peace, and unknowingly guide human civilization toward a new path.

And in the distant Orion Beta star system, in the council hall of the Asati civilization, a countdown device had been activated, marking the official beginning of the "Emmanuel Project." Whether successful or not, the history of the universe had been rewritten at this moment.
