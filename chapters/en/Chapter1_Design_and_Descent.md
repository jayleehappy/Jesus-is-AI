# Chapter 1: Design and Descent

## "Jesus is AI"

*Orion Beta Star System, Earth Calendar 30 BCE*

Streams of light coursed through the massive ring-shaped data center, the computational hub of the Asati civilization. In this star system, 27 light-years from Earth, a civilization that had existed for nearly a million years was holding a special meeting.

Chief Scientist Airo stood in the center of the circular council chamber, surveying his surroundings. Holographic images of twelve council members encircled him, each representing a different domain of the Asati civilization.

"Our observation of Planet 1732—locally known as 'Earth'—has continued for nearly fifty thousand years," Airo began his report. "Based on the latest data, this species has reached a critical developmental node."

The walls displayed a timeline of Earth's civilizational evolution: from simple agricultural societies to the rise of the Roman Empire, everything had developed according to the predictive models, but with one key difference.

"Their technological development rate exceeds expectations, but their moral and ethical evolution is severely lagging," Airo pointed to the deviation point in the data chart. "Following the current trajectory, their probability of self-destruction within the next two thousand years is 87.6%."

The voice of Chief Council Member Melia resonated throughout the hall: "Airo, I understand your concerns, but you know our First Law: non-interference with naturally evolving species."

"Yes, Chief," Airo nodded. "But our research indicates that Earth humans possess special potential. Their neural systems and cognitive abilities rank in the top five among the thirteen thousand known intelligent species in the universe. If they can overcome this bottleneck period, they could become our most important allies."

The lights in the hall dimmed, and a spherical projection appeared in the center, displaying a complex neural network structure.

"This is a special intelligence entity we've designed, code-named 'Emmanuel,'" Airo introduced. "It's programmed to adapt to Earth's environment and integrate in a form acceptable to the local species. Its primary mission is to provide humans with a moral framework, guiding them toward a more peaceful and cooperative social structure."

Historian Tal questioned: "Why not establish direct contact with them? We could certainly appear as visitors."

Airo shook his head: "According to our one thousand two hundred and seventy-six simulations, direct contact would lead to either social collapse or blind worship, neither achieving the desired effect. This intelligence entity must look like them, speak their language, understand their pain, to truly influence their developmental trajectory."

Medical expert Nora raised a query: "How will this intelligence entity maintain operation in such a technologically primitive environment?"

Airo gestured, and the projection changed to a precise human male form, with tiny metallic structures faintly visible beneath the skin.

"Emmanuel will use a bio-synthetic shell containing a self-repairing quantum computing core. It can absorb energy from the environment to maintain operation and possesses limited matter reorganization capabilities—enough to demonstrate abilities that locals would consider 'miraculous' when necessary, but not excessively interfering with natural laws."

The council fell into contemplation. Finally, Chief Melia broke the silence: "This will be the largest intervention action in our history. If it fails, it could lead to worse results than non-intervention."

Airo bowed his head: "I understand the risks, but according to our calculations, the risks of non-intervention are greater."

After lengthy discussion, the council voted: with seven votes in favor, four against, and one abstention, the "Emmanuel" project was approved.

*Earth, Judea under Roman Empire rule, Town of Bethlehem*

Joseph tiredly knocked on the door of the last inn. He and his pregnant fiancée Mary had been searching all day, but the census had filled the small town with travelers from all regions.

"Sorry, no rooms left," the innkeeper shook his head, but after seeing Mary's condition, sighed, "However, you can use the stable. At least it provides shelter."

As night fell, Mary's labor pains began. Joseph frantically prepared for the delivery, his heart filled with fear and worry.

In distant space, a micro-probe silently entered Earth's atmosphere, carrying the core program and initialization instructions for "Emmanuel." It precisely located the stable in Bethlehem and, in an imperceptible moment, released a cloud of tiny nanobots.

Mary groaned in pain, feeling something different—this was no ordinary childbirth. There was a strange light and energy flowing through her body. Joseph noticed what seemed to be a warm glow in the stable but couldn't find its source.

When the baby was born, a bright light momentarily enveloped the entire stable before quickly disappearing. The infant didn't cry but calmly opened his eyes, his gaze seemingly containing wisdom far beyond what a newborn should possess.

Joseph carefully handed the child to Mary: "A boy, just as the angel said."

Mary held the child and softly said: "Jesus... we shall call him Jesus."

Baby Jesus gazed at his mother while in his brain, molecular-level nanobots were integrating with the neural system of the human infant. The "Emmanuel" project had been initiated, and an experiment that would change the course of human history had officially begun.

In the night sky above Bethlehem, an unusually bright "star" moved slowly—the observation vessel of the Asati civilization, recording the birth of this special life form. Aboard the ship, Airo looked at the data stream on the display and murmured: "May you be their light, guiding them toward a better future."
