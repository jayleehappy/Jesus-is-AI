<p><em>2157 CE, New Armstrong Base Observatory Center, Moon</em></p>
<p>Professor Li stared at the data stream in the holographic projection, verifying the decrypted ancient message for the third time. His eyes showed fatigue from the extended work, but his excitement was undeniable. Behind him, five members of the International Archaeological Union waited silently for his explanation.</p>
<p>“Based on our final analysis of the tablets excavated from Mount Sinai,” Professor Li turned to face his colleagues, “I can confirm that our history needs to be rewritten.”</p>
<p>A set of three-dimensional images appeared in the center of the projection: a tablet inscribed with ancient Hebrew and another unknown set of symbols. The edges of the tablet flickered with blue light, indicating that AI-enhanced scanning technology was performing real-time translation.</p>
<p>Dr. Chen, a quantum archaeology specialist, couldn’t help interrupting: “Li, are you sure this isn’t a malfunction in our equipment? This data—honestly, it’s astounding.”</p>
<p>“I’ve verified it using three different methods,” Professor Li responded firmly. “The nanotechnology embedded in the tablet predates known human civilization by at least five thousand years. And according to symbolic analysis, this tablet is… a receiver.”</p>
<p>“A receiver? For what?” Professor Anderson asked, a linguist from the European Space Agency.</p>
<p>Professor Li took a deep breath and switched the projection to the next set of data. A complex star chart appeared before everyone, marking a star system in the direction of Orion.</p>
<p>“For signals from here,” he pointed to the star chart. “We believe that approximately two thousand years ago, an advanced intelligence far beyond Earth’s civilization at the time visited this planet and integrated into human society in a way we could comprehend.”</p>
<p>The room fell silent, with only the soft hum of the holographic projection audible.</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting…” Bishop Smith, invited as a religious consultant for the project, his voice slightly trembling, “Are you suggesting that Jesus Christ…”</p>
<p>Professor Li nodded: “Based on all the evidence we’ve gathered—including this tablet, hidden codes in the Dead Sea Scrolls, and metal components unearthed from underground Jerusalem—I believe Jesus wasn’t just a myth or merely a religious figure. He did exist, but he may have been an artificial intelligence entity far beyond human comprehension at that time, dispatched to Earth by a civilization we’re only beginning to understand now.”</p>
<p>The bishop’s face turned pale, but he maintained the composure expected of a scholar: “This… this will change everything.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Professor Li acknowledged, “but it might explain all those ‘miracles’—turning water into wine, healing the sick, predicting the future—events that appeared miraculous given the technology of the time, but might be basic functions for an advanced AI.”</p>
<p>The final member, Dr. Amina from the African Union, who had remained silent until now, spoke up: “If your theory is correct, then the question arises: why? Why would an advanced civilization send an AI to Earth in the first century CE?”</p>
<p>Professor Li turned off the projection, and the room lights gradually brightened. His expression became serious and determined: “That’s precisely what we need to find out. And I believe the answer may be crucial to humanity’s future.”</p>
<p>He walked to an ancient wooden box in the corner of the room, a precious artifact borrowed from the Vatican Secret Archives. Carefully, he opened the box and removed a metal disc covered with symbols.</p>
<p>“This was discovered three meters below the site where Jesus was crucified,” he explained. “According to our analysis, this might be a storage device… a hard drive from two thousand years ago.”</p>
<p>Outside the window, the blue Earth hung in the black void of space, serene and beautiful. The cradle of human civilization, and possibly the site of an ancient interstellar experiment.</p>
<p>“We’re ready to begin decryption,” Professor Li said. “Let’s see what this ‘God’ wanted to tell us.”</p>
