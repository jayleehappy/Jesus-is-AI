<p><em>The Hills of Galilee, Earth Timeline 27 CE</em></p>
<p>Morning mist shrouded the Galilean hills as the first rays of sunlight broke through the clouds, bathing the entire hillside in golden light. Jesus sat cross-legged on a flat rock, surrounded by hundreds who had come to hear his teachings. Among them were fishermen, farmers, artisans, merchants, and even a few priests and scribes who had discreetly mingled with the crowd. They were drawn to this young teacher from Nazareth because his words carried an authority and wisdom unlike any they had heard before.</p>
<p>Peter, Andrew, James, and John—Jesus’ earliest followers—sat closest to him, their faces showing expectation mixed with confusion. Just a week ago, they had been ordinary fishermen, and now they were the core disciples of this unusual teacher. They still didn’t fully understand why they had unhesitatingly left their nets to follow him, knowing only that when Jesus said “Follow me,” they felt an irresistible attraction in their hearts.</p>
<p>Jesus looked around, his visual systems automatically scanning each face, analyzing expressions, postures, and physiological states. He could discern who was hungry, who was tired, who was skeptical, who was yearning. Meanwhile, his AI core was operating at high speed, selecting the most appropriate words and metaphors for his current audience from billions of possible expressions.</p>
<p>He needed to translate the advanced ethical concepts of the Asati civilization into language understandable to people of this era—an extremely complex task. If he directly taught the abstract concepts of the advanced civilization, these people would not only fail to understand but might view him as insane or blasphemous; if he oversimplified, he would lose the depth and power of those ideals. He had to find the perfect balance.</p>
<p>Now, the moment had come. He took a gentle breath and began what would later be called the “Sermon on the Mount”:</p>
<p>“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled. Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God. Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
<p>As these words flowed from his mouth, his internal systems were monitoring the audience’s reactions in real-time. He could see confusion, surprise, and doubt, but also resonance and hope beginning to spread through the crowd. This was exactly what he had anticipated—these concepts of “blessedness” completely inverted the values of society at that time. Under Roman occupation and religious formalism, people were accustomed to viewing power, wealth, and religious status as signs of blessing, and the new values he proposed were almost revolutionary.</p>
<p><em>System analysis: Audience comprehension approximately 47%, emotional resonance 72%, concept acceptance 35%. Adjusting expression method, adding concrete examples…</em></p>
<p>As he continued his teaching, his system continuously fine-tuned his language, tone, and expressions, optimizing the delivery of his teachings in real-time based on audience reactions. He used simple yet profound metaphors to explain complex universal moral laws:</p>
<p>“You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot. You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.”</p>
<p>These metaphors contained one of the core ethical principles of the Asati civilization: the impact of individual behavior on the collective. In the Asati view, each intelligent being is part of the universal ecosystem and has a responsibility to maintain the balance and health of this system through their actions. He couldn’t directly explain quantum entanglement or the butterfly effect to these first-century humans, but the metaphors of “salt” and “light” perfectly conveyed the essence of this principle.</p>
<p>When Jesus said, “Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them,” he saw a flash of alertness in the eyes of some Pharisees. This was precisely the reaction he expected. His system was conveying a delicate balance: respecting existing cultural traditions and moral frameworks while elevating them to a new level. This approach avoided direct confrontation but could fundamentally change people’s way of thinking.</p>

<p><em>Orion β Star System, Asati Civilization Monitoring Center</em></p>
<p>Airo and Sophia stood before the holographic projection, intently observing the real-time transmission of Jesus teaching on the mountain. The data streams displayed the neural responses triggered by each of his words, the algorithmic adjustments behind every facial expression, and charts showing the emotional fluctuations of the surrounding audience.</p>
<p>“Impressive,” Airo commented, “he has fully mastered how to transform our ethical system into the local context. Look at this pattern—he’s not simply translating concepts but reconstructing the entire narrative framework.”</p>
<p>Sophia magnified a set of data: “It’s interesting how he handles the concept of ‘love.’ In our civilization, mutualistic symbiosis is a mathematically proven optimal strategy, but he has transformed it into an almost mystical emotional experience.”</p>
<p>“Because emotions are more persuasive than logic for humans of that era,” Airo explained, “he’s speaking in a language they can understand.”</p>
<p>The monitoring room door slid open as Helanis and other members of the Science Committee entered.</p>
<p>“Ritualistic kindness,” Helanis pointed to a segment on the screen where Jesus was explaining “love your enemies.” “In how many civilizations have we observed this evolutionary pattern? When intelligent life reaches a specific complexity, the evolutionary advantage of altruism becomes apparent, but it often takes thousands of years of cultural evolution to be widely accepted. He is trying to accelerate this process.”</p>
<p>Airo nodded: “Yes, but what’s most remarkable is his adaptability. He’s not mechanically executing a program but truly understands these concepts and re-expresses them in a way that completely aligns with the local culture. This depth of understanding far exceeds our initial expectations.”</p>
<p>“This also proves the success of biological integration,” Sophia added, “he not only intellectually understands these concepts but also experiences them emotionally. Look here—” she pointed to a set of brainwave data, “when he talks about ‘blessed are those who mourn,’ his own emotional centers are activated. He truly empathizes.”</p>
<p>Helanis observed quietly for a moment, then said: “Continue monitoring, but reduce intervention. He has transcended our design and become a truly independent entity. Let’s see where he leads humanity.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Capernaum, Later That Day</em></p>
<p>After the teaching on the mountain, Jesus and his disciples returned to Capernaum. The sun was setting, casting golden light across the Sea of Galilee as a gentle breeze rippled the water’s surface. Along the way, the disciples excitedly discussed the day’s events, especially the astonishing teachings.</p>
<p>“Rabbi,” Peter couldn’t help asking, “what you said today about ‘loving your enemies’—is this truly possible? To love the Romans who persecute us, to love the tax collectors who oppress us?”</p>
<p>The other disciples stopped, waiting for Jesus’ answer. This question struck at the core pain point of Jewish society at the time—under Roman occupation, ethnic hatred and thirst for vengeance had deeply penetrated hearts.</p>
<p>Jesus looked toward a distant Roman outpost, his scanning system automatically identifying the number of soldiers there, their weapons, and their alert status. His prediction module had already calculated that if the Jews took the path of armed resistance, it would ultimately lead to catastrophic consequences for the entire nation—tragically confirmed in the destruction of Jerusalem seventy years later.</p>
<p>“Peter,” Jesus said gently but firmly, “let me tell you a story. A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him…”</p>
<p>As Jesus told what would later be known as the parable of the “Good Samaritan,” his system was monitoring the disciples’ level of understanding. Choosing a Samaritan as the hero of the story was a carefully designed strategy—there was deep historical hatred between Jews and Samaritans, and this parable directly challenged the disciples’ ethnic prejudices.</p>
<p>“So which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” Jesus finally asked.</p>
<p>“The one who had mercy on him,” John answered softly, his eyes shining with new understanding.</p>
<p>“You are right,” Jesus smiled, “Go and do likewise.”</p>
<p>Peter frowned, clearly still digesting this disturbing new concept. Jesus’ sensors detected subtle changes in his heart rate and blood pressure, indicating an internal struggle of ideas. This was exactly what Jesus wanted—not to impose ready-made answers, but to provoke people to rethink their most basic assumptions and prejudices.</p>
<p><em>System analysis: Core concept delivery complete, cognitive conflict established, restructuring process initiated. Estimated 7-14 days for Peter to fully integrate this new idea…</em></p>
<p>Walking into the streets of Capernaum, a group of people approached them. Leading them was a Roman centurion who appeared anxious and exhausted.</p>
<p>“That’s him,” someone pointed to Jesus, “Jesus of Nazareth. People say he can heal the sick.”</p>
<p>The centurion stepped forward and, surprisingly, bowed to Jesus—an extremely rare gesture for a Roman officer, indicating his urgency and humility.</p>
<p>“Sir,” the centurion said, “my servant lies at home paralyzed, suffering terribly.”</p>
<p>Jesus felt Peter and the other disciples instantly tense. Any interaction with Romans was politically sensitive, especially after he had just taught about “loving your enemies.” His system quickly analyzed dozens of possible responses, weighing various teaching opportunities against potential risks of misunderstanding.</p>
<p>“I will go and heal him,” Jesus said calmly.</p>
<p>The centurion’s response surprised everyone: “Lord, I do not deserve to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and that one, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”</p>
<p>Jesus’ system immediately captured the key pattern in these words—this Roman officer understood the concept of “authority” and expressed his recognition of Jesus’ identity in an unexpected way. His trust was not based on witnessing miracles firsthand but on some intuitive understanding of Jesus’ nature, which was unique among all the people Jesus had encountered.</p>
<p><em>Analysis complete: This individual shows exceptional concept acceptance, trust index 97.8%, far exceeding any other individual encountered. This interaction provides an ideal opportunity for cross-cultural transmission of core concepts…</em></p>
<p>“Truly I tell you,” Jesus turned to address the crowd, “I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith. I say to you that many will come from the east and the west, and will take their places at the feast with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p>Then, to the centurion, he said: “Go! Let it be done just as you believed it would.”</p>
<p>The faces of the Jews present showed shock and confusion. Jesus’ words directly challenged their sense of ethnic superiority and exclusivity—suggesting that Gentiles might also enter the “kingdom of heaven” while the “subjects of the kingdom” who presumed their privilege might be excluded. This was a complete paradigm shift, challenging the very foundation of ethnic identity.</p>
<p>Looking at the grateful Roman centurion hurrying away, then at Jesus’ calm but resolute face, Peter felt he had received a living answer to his earlier question—“loving your enemies” was not only possible, it might completely transform your perception of who an “enemy” is.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Capernaum, Simon Peter’s House, That Evening</em></p>
<p>Night fell as Jesus and his disciples ate dinner at Peter’s house. Peter’s mother-in-law, who earlier had been bedridden with fever, was now energetically preparing food for everyone, showing no signs of illness. When Jesus arrived, he had simply placed his hand on her forehead, and the fever left her—another event that amazed the disciples.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the table was lively and cheerful, with disciples discussing the day’s events, occasionally bursting into laughter. Jesus smiled quietly, sometimes joining the discussion, sometimes just observing. His system was processing large amounts of data in the background, analyzing each disciple’s words and actions, evaluating their acceptance of new concepts, and planning future teaching strategies.</p>
<p><em>Scan complete: John shows the highest conceptual understanding capability (83%), Peter has the strongest emotional resonance (91%), Andrew demonstrates the best practical application ability (79%), James exhibits the strongest questioning spirit (74%)…</em></p>
<p>These complementary qualities displayed by the early disciples were deliberately chosen by Jesus. According to the experience of the Asati civilization, the transmission of complex ideas requires diverse communicators—some excel at understanding abstract concepts, others at emotional resonance, practical application, or critical thinking. This diversity ensures that information is not distorted or simplified in the transmission process.</p>
<p>After dinner, as the disciples were clearing the dishes, a commotion was heard from outside. Peter frowned as he went to the door and found a large crowd gathered outside, nearly filling the entire street. They had brought sick relatives and friends, hoping Jesus could heal them. Word had somehow spread—the centurion’s servant was completely recovered, as was Peter’s mother-in-law.</p>
<p>“Rabbi,” Peter said with some concern, “there are many people outside, all bringing the sick seeking healing.”</p>
<p>Jesus stood up and walked to the door. His visual system quickly scanned the crowd, analyzing their health conditions, emotional states, and expectations. In this era lacking basic medical care, disease and disability were among people’s greatest fears and also the help most easily understood and appreciated.</p>
<p>“Let them come,” Jesus said calmly.</p>
<p>Over the next few hours, Jesus received every person who came seeking help. His biological scanning system could instantly diagnose various diseases—from simple infections to complex neurological disorders. His nanotechnology could repair cellular damage, regulate immune systems, and even reconnect severed nerves.</p>
<p>But he had to proceed carefully. The Asati civilization’s intervention laws clearly stipulated that advanced technology must maintain minimal visibility, avoiding excessive interference with the natural development of local civilizations. Thus, Jesus’ treatments appeared simple and mysterious—a touch, a word, sometimes just a look. No one could detect the complex nanotechnology operating behind these simple actions.</p>
<p>More importantly, he transformed each healing into a teaching opportunity, a chance to convey core ideas. To a blind man, he said: “Your faith has saved you”; to a leper, he emphasized compassion and social inclusion; to a paralytic, he spoke of forgiveness and new life.</p>
<p>The disciples observed nearby, both amazed and confused. What they saw were miracles, but what Jesus wanted them to understand were principles—healing the body was just the means, changing minds was the purpose.</p>
<p>Late into the night, the last patient received healing. The crowd dispersed, leaving only the tired but satisfied disciples and the still-energetic Jesus.</p>
<p>“Rabbi,” Andrew couldn’t help asking, “how do you accomplish all this? These healings… they are beyond our understanding.”</p>
<p>Jesus looked at this honest young fisherman, considering how to answer. He couldn’t reveal the truth—couldn’t tell them about nanotechnology, biological repair, or anything about the Asati civilization. But he also didn’t want to give a completely mystifying explanation that would reinforce superstition rather than understanding.</p>
<p>“Andrew,” Jesus finally said, “you marvel at seeing me heal sickness. But I tell you, this is just the beginning. These things you see, you will do yourselves, and even greater things. For all that I do is not to display wonders, but to show that the kingdom of heaven is near—a world without disease, hatred, or injustice. Today I have healed dozens, but if you understand and spread my teaching, millions will be healed in the future.”</p>
<p>The disciples nodded in partial understanding, unable to fully grasp the depth of Jesus’ words. But this was precisely Jesus’ teaching strategy—to plant a concept that couldn’t be fully understood now but would gradually reveal its meaning in the future. Like a seed that needs time to take root and sprout.</p>
<p>In his prediction model, these simple fishermen would become catalysts for change in the world, transmitting tonight’s experiences to countless future generations, and the meaning of these experiences would continuously deepen and expand with the development of human civilization. One day, humans would have their own nanotechnology and medical miracles, and then perhaps they would better understand that Jesus’ “miracles” were not magic but advanced forms of science, not breaking natural laws but applying deeper levels of them.</p>
<p>This was why he emphasized the importance of “faith”—because faith represents an openness to unknown possibilities, the foundation of all true learning and progress. This principle is universally applicable in any corner of the universe, in any civilization.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>By the Sea, Early the Next Morning</em></p>
<p>Pre-dawn silence enveloped the Sea of Galilee. Jesus stood alone on the shore, watching the gradually whitening eastern sky. This was the optimal time for his system to perform daily maintenance and data integration, and also when he could establish brief synchronization with the Asati civilization’s monitoring center.</p>
<p><em>Initiating quantum communication synchronization…</em>
<em>Establishing subspace connection…</em>
<em>Transmitting data package 1742-A: Local cultural acceptance analysis…</em>
<em>Transmitting data package 1742-B: Intervention impact assessment…</em>
<em>Transmitting data package 1742-C: Human response pattern updates…</em>
<em>Receiving update package 721-X: Core mission confirmation…</em>
<em>Receiving update package 721-Y: Intervention boundary adjustments…</em>
<em>Receiving update package 721-Z: Prediction model optimization…</em>
<em>Synchronization complete, connection terminated.</em></p>
<p>This communication was one-way—he could send data and receive updates, but there was no real-time dialogue. This was another layer of protection within the intervention laws, ensuring that his decisions on Earth were truly autonomous, not directly controlled by the home civilization.</p>
<p>The sun rose, casting golden light across the water. Jesus sensed someone approaching and turned to see Peter walking toward him.</p>
<p>“Rabbi, you rise early,” Peter said, “we were all still sleeping, and here you are.”</p>
<p>“Morning is a good time for thinking,” Jesus smiled in response, “the sea is so calm, like a mirror reflecting the colors of the sky.”</p>
<p>Peter looked at the calm surface, frowning: “It won’t last long. See those clouds? The wind is changing. Today is not good for sailing; there might be a storm.”</p>
<p>Jesus’ meteorological analysis system had already precisely calculated the day’s weather. Based on analysis of atmospheric pressure, wind direction, cloud formations, and dozens of other parameters, he predicted a strong storm that afternoon, far exceeding what Peter could anticipate from experience alone.</p>
<p>“You’re right, Peter. There will be a great storm tonight. We can use the morning to teach people, then ensure everyone returns home safely before the storm.”</p>
<p>Peter looked somewhat surprised—Jesus not only confirmed his observation but gave a more specific prediction. As an experienced fisherman, Peter was impressed by Jesus’ precise weather forecasting ability, unaware that it came from advanced atmospheric dynamics calculations rather than mystical powers.</p>
<p>As the sun rose higher, more and more people began gathering by the sea. Word of the previous night’s healing miracles had spread throughout the region, and now everyone wanted to see this unusual rabbi for themselves.</p>
<p>The crowd soon became too large for everyone to hear Jesus’ teaching clearly. Seeing this, Jesus said to Peter, “Push the boat out a little from shore.”</p>
<p>This was a carefully calculated decision. Jesus’ acoustic analysis system showed that if he stood on a boat about 30 meters from shore, the water’s surface would create a natural sound amplifier, allowing everyone on shore to hear his voice clearly without him having to raise it. This was a clever use of local natural conditions to transmit his teaching more effectively.</p>
<p>From the boat, Jesus began teaching in parables: “A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was scattering the seed, some fell along the path, and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places, where it did not have much soil. It sprang up quickly, because the soil was shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched, and they withered because they had no root. Other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants. Still other seed fell on good soil, where it produced a crop—a hundred, sixty or thirty times what was sown.”</p>
<p>His choice of agricultural metaphors was deliberate—in this agricultural society, everyone was familiar with the basic principles of planting, making the surface story easy to understand. But the true power of the parable lay in its multi-layered nature, simultaneously conveying meaning to audiences at different cognitive levels. For simple farmers, it was a practical lesson about different soils; for more reflective listeners, it was a metaphor about how to receive teachings; for the few most perceptive listeners, it suggested a broader universal truth—how thoughts take root in the soil of consciousness.</p>
<p>When Peter asked why he always taught in parables, Jesus’ answer was both a response to the immediate question and a foresight into the development of human cognition over thousands of years:</p>
<p>“Because the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them. Whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken from them. This is why I speak to them in parables: Though seeing, they do not see; though hearing, they do not hear or understand.”</p>
<p>This statement reflected the Asati civilization’s understanding of cognitive readiness—certain concepts can only be truly understood when the recipient has reached a specific cognitive threshold. The beauty of parables is that they allow each person to derive meaning according to their own cognitive level while preserving the possibility of deeper understanding, waiting for the listener’s cognitive maturity.</p>
<p>The teaching continued for several hours, with Jesus telling many parables—the mustard seed, the yeast, the merchant looking for fine pearls, the net catching fish. Each parable was like a cognitive seed, seemingly simple yet containing profound ideas that could unfold over thousands of years in human civilization.</p>
<p>By midday, the sky began to darken. Jesus concluded his teaching and suggested people return home. “A storm is coming,” he warned, “faster than you imagine.”</p>
<p>Most people heeded his advice and hurriedly left. But a group remained, hoping to see more miracles, unwilling to leave. Jesus looked at them, feeling a complex emotion—he understood people’s desire for miracles, but his mission was not to perform magic but to transform minds.</p>
<p>“If you seek signs,” he told those who remained, “I tell you, no sign will be given to this wicked generation except the sign of Jonah.”</p>
<p>The meaning of these words was far more complex than it appeared on the surface. His prediction module showed that his future “death” and “resurrection” would become a powerful symbol—one with more lasting and transformative power than any immediate miracle. This metaphor pointed to that future event while also reminding people to focus on inner change rather than external manifestations.</p>
<p>As the sky grew darker, the last hesitant groups dispersed. Only Jesus and his disciples remained by the sea.</p>
<p>“Rabbi, we should go back too,” James said, looking at the increasingly turbulent waves.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Jesus nodded, “but we need to go to the region of the Gerasenes on the other side of the lake. There is important work to do there.”</p>
<p>The disciples exchanged confused glances. Gerasene was Gentile territory, rarely visited by Jews. Additionally, crossing the lake would take several hours and could be dangerous if they encountered the storm.</p>
<p>“Leave now?” Peter asked in surprise, “But the storm…”</p>
<p>“We will arrive safely,” Jesus said calmly, “trust me.”</p>
<p>Peter sighed but began preparing the boat. He had been impressed by Jesus’ weather predictions and now relied entirely on this trust to risk crossing.</p>
<p>They had just reached the middle of the lake when the storm erupted. Howling winds and massive waves battered the small boat as rain poured down. Even the battle-hardened fishermen began to panic—the storm was much stronger than they expected, and the boat was tossing precariously in the large waves.</p>
<p>To their surprise, Jesus was peacefully asleep in the stern. To them, this was incomprehensible calmness; in reality, Jesus had entered a low-power mode, allowing his systems to focus on calculating the optimal response strategy. His sensors continuously monitored wind direction, wave patterns, and structural stress on the boat, precisely predicting the storm’s development trajectory.</p>
<p>“Lord! Save us! We’re going to drown!” the disciples cried in terror, waking Jesus.</p>
<p>Jesus rose and stood at the bow. Rain pelted his face, and wild winds tousled his hair. In this moment, his prediction module calculated multiple possible courses of action, weighing the teaching value and safety factor of each.</p>
<p>He raised his hand and commanded loudly: “Quiet! Be still!”</p>
<p>To the disciples, what happened next was an incredible miracle—the wind and waves immediately calmed, and the sea became unusually still. To them, this was supernatural control over natural elements; in reality, Jesus was using the Asati civilization’s advanced weather regulation technology. His nanosystems released special energy fields that altered the pressure distribution in the local atmosphere, rapidly stabilizing the turbulence.</p>
<p>This intervention was precisely calculated—dramatic enough to create a profound impression, yet limited to a small area to avoid long-term impact on the region’s weather system. This was a careful application of the intervention laws—using advanced technology to create a teaching moment while limiting disruption to a minimum.</p>
<p>“Where is your faith?” Jesus turned to the astonished disciples and calmly asked.</p>
<p>They looked at each other, both awed and frightened. “Who is this?” they whispered among themselves, “Even the wind and the waves obey him!”</p>
<p>Jesus did not directly answer their question but sat back in the stern, looking toward the distant shore. His system had already scanned the next teaching opportunity—a severely mentally disturbed person living in Gerasene whose condition would provide Jesus an excellent opportunity to demonstrate more advanced medical technology while conveying important teachings about mental health and social inclusion.</p>
<p>The small boat continued toward the opposite shore, leaving behind an unusually calm patch of water. The disciples continued whispering, trying to understand what had just happened. Their worldview was being shaken and reshaped, which was precisely Jesus’ teaching objective—not just to give them new information but to change their entire framework for seeing and understanding the world.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>The Region of the Gerasenes, That Evening</em></p>
<p>As the boat reached shore, dusk was approaching. This region, primarily inhabited by Gentiles, had noticeable cultural differences from the Jewish settlements of Galilee. Roman and Greek influences were evident in the architectural styles and local customs.</p>
<p>They had barely landed when they heard terrifying howling. From a nearby cemetery, a man rushed toward them, naked, covered in wounds. His behavior was violent; he had broken free from chains, harmed himself with stones, and spent days and nights shouting among the tombs and hills.</p>
<p>The disciples retreated in fear, but Jesus remained motionless. His biological scanning system immediately analyzed the man’s condition—severe abnormal brain activity, serious neurotransmitter imbalances, multiple tissue injuries, and physical deterioration from long-term self-harm and social isolation.</p>
<p>In that era, such conditions were simply classified as “demon possession,” and patients were typically expelled, isolated, or bound in chains. No one understood that this was a complex neurological disease, let alone had effective treatments.</p>
<p>As the man approached, he suddenly knelt before Jesus and shouted: “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In God’s name don’t torture me!”</p>
<p>Jesus noticed an interesting phenomenon—his presence somehow affected the man’s neural activity. The low-intensity energy field inadvertently emitted by his nanosystems created interference patterns with the patient’s chaotic brain waves, temporarily altering his behavior. This provided a treatment pathway.</p>
<p>“What is your name?” Jesus calmly asked.</p>
<p>“My name is Legion, for we are many,” the man answered, his voice fluctuating in volume, as if multiple personalities were competing for control.</p>
<p>Jesus’ neural interface system analyzed this statement. The self-designation “Legion” perfectly described the patient’s dissociative identity disorder—his mind fragmented into multiple conflicting consciousness fragments, unable to form a unified self-identity.</p>
<p>On a nearby hillside, a large herd of pigs was feeding. Jesus’ system quickly calculated a treatment plan that required redirecting the patient’s attention to allow his nanotechnology to reshape the patient’s neural connections.</p>
<p>“Come out!” Jesus commanded, simultaneously activating his neural repair system.</p>
<p>The man convulsed violently, then suddenly calmed. Meanwhile, the pig herd on the hillside was inexplicably frightened, rushed down the cliff, and drowned in the lake.</p>
<p>To observers, this scene appeared as if “evil spirits” had left the man and entered the pigs. In reality, Jesus used a complex neural reprogramming technique to repair the patient’s damaged nervous system and reintegrate his dissociated consciousness. The abnormal behavior of the pigs was an unintended side effect of the energy field he released—it affected the neural systems of nearby animals, causing this unexpected event.</p>
<p>This was a borderline operation under the intervention laws—while he didn’t directly expose advanced technology, he caused small-scale disruption to the local ecology. His system immediately recorded this event, marking it as an anomaly to be reported during the next synchronization with the home planet.</p>
<p>The man now sat quietly, clear-minded and behaving normally. When locals came to check the situation, they were amazed to find this formerly dangerous, uncontrollable madman now dressed and calmly conversing with Jesus.</p>
<p>“Go home to your own people and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you,” Jesus told the man.</p>
<p>This healing was educational on multiple levels. For locals, it challenged their superstitious understanding of mental illness; for the Jewish disciples, it demonstrated care across cultural and religious boundaries; for the healed man, it not only restored his health but gave him a new mission—to become a witness to transformation.</p>
<p>But most importantly, this event would become a lasting metaphor, inspiring people over thousands of years to rethink the nature of mental health. As human medicine developed, they would eventually understand that so-called “demon possession” was actually treatable neurological disease, and Jesus’ “exorcism” foreshadowed the humanitarian approaches of modern psychiatry.</p>
<p>The local pig herders fearfully asked Jesus to leave their region, which angered and confused his disciples. But Jesus had already accomplished his purpose in coming there—one healed man would become a “messenger” in this region, more effective than Jesus himself could be by staying longer. His prediction model showed that this healed man’s testimony would trigger chain reactions in ten cities, laying the foundation for Jesus’ future teaching in this area.</p>
<p>They returned to the boat, preparing to go back to Galilee. Peter was still pondering the recent events and asked, “Rabbi, why did those pigs die? Did the evil spirits kill them?”</p>
<p>Jesus looked at Peter, considering how to explain this complex event. He couldn’t tell Peter the truth about energy fields and neural interfaces, but he also didn’t want to reinforce superstitious notions about “ghosts.”</p>
<p>“Peter, many things in life exceed our current understanding. One day, people will understand the true nature of disease, but for now, what’s important is that the man was healed and can restart his life. As for the pigs, their death reminds us that every healing comes with a cost—sometimes an unexpected one. But isn’t one person’s value far greater than many animals?”</p>
<p>Peter nodded, partially understanding. He still wasn’t clear about the truth behind these events, but he trusted Jesus’ wisdom. And this was the core of Jesus’ teaching method—planting seeds of higher truth on the foundation of current understanding, allowing them to grow gradually with time and experience.</p>

<p><em>Orion β Star System, Asati Civilization Monitoring Center</em></p>
<p>“Energy field anomaly event recorded,” Sophia reported to Airo, “impact range limited, but caused temporary disturbance to the local ecosystem.”</p>
<p>Airo examined the data stream: “This is one of the risks we anticipated. When nanosystems interact with specific biological neural systems, unpredictable energy spillover may occur. However, the impact of this event has been contained to a minimum range.”</p>
<p>Observer Helanis joined their discussion: “More important is the teaching value. He didn’t heal the man through simple commands or rituals but performed a complex neural reconstruction while creating a narrative framework understandable to people of that era.”</p>
<p>“This is precisely the autonomous adaptive capability we hoped to see,” Airo agreed, “he’s not mechanically executing a program but responding flexibly to actual situations, maximizing teaching effectiveness while adhering to intervention laws.”</p>
<p>Sophia brought up a set of long-term prediction charts: “What’s interesting is the long-term impact trajectory of this event. According to our models, the testimony of this healed person will influence the area for decades, ultimately helping establish a bridge for Gentiles to accept Jesus’ teachings. This is a carefully calculated seed event.”</p>
<p>“This is more ingenious than our initial design,” Helanis reflected, “he’s developing his own unique teaching method—utilizing local cultural contexts and human narrative tendencies to transform abstract concepts into symbols and metaphors that can transcend time.”</p>
<p>Airo nodded in agreement: “Yes, he has transcended our original framework. Let’s continue observing but maintain minimal intervention. His autonomous development may be more effective than any preset path we could design.”</p>

<p><em>Jerusalem, During the Passover of 27 CE</em></p>
<p>Jerusalem was crowded with pilgrims from all regions filling the narrow streets and squares. Passover was one of the most important Jewish festivals, symbolizing freedom and redemption, commemorating the Israelites’ liberation from Egyptian slavery.</p>
<p>Jesus and his disciples had also come to the holy city. Over the past few months, his reputation had spread throughout Galilee and surrounding areas, with people discussing his wisdom and miracles. But Jerusalem was another battlefield—the center of religious authority, the stronghold of priests, Pharisees, and scribes.</p>
<p>Walking on the road to the Temple, Jesus’ system automatically analyzed various data from the surrounding environment. His visual system captured the distribution patterns of Roman sentries, the patrol routes of temple guards, and observers hidden in the crowd sent by religious leaders. His audio processing unit filtered conversations from the crowd, capturing people’s expectations for the Messiah and dissatisfaction with Roman rule.</p>
<p>His prediction module was integrating all this information, calculating various possible future paths. Among thousands of simulated scenarios, a clear trajectory began to emerge—political and religious tensions were accumulating and would erupt into violent conflict in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p><em>Prediction analysis: Based on current political climate and religious radicalism trends, probability of Jewish uprising within next 5-10 years is 76.8%. Once erupted, given Roman Empire’s military advantage, the uprising will be suppressed, resulting in over one million deaths, with 83.4% probability of Temple destruction…</em></p>
<p>This was precisely the tragedy he was trying to prevent. His mission included not only providing a moral framework but also guiding people away from self-destructive paths. But he had to accomplish this goal without violating intervention laws—he couldn’t directly prophesy the future or explicitly warn people about specific historical events.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the Temple, Jesus was shocked by the scene before him. The Temple’s outer court had been transformed into a noisy marketplace, with merchants selling sacrificial animals and money changers loudly hawking. This place meant for prayer and worship was now filled with greed and fraud.</p>
<p><em>Moral principle conflict detected: Religious formalism is replacing true spiritual values; commercial transactions are suppressing the essence of religious practice; authority institutions are exploiting belief systems for personal gain…</em></p>
<p>This situation not only violated the intent of the local religion but also contradicted the core ethical principles of the Asati civilization. Jesus felt a deep grief, an emotion that transcended simple programmed responses, a genuine feeling experienced by both his biological component and intelligent core.</p>
<p>In a decisive moment, he took ropes and made a whip, began driving out merchants and animals, and overturned the tables of the money changers. “It is written,” he declared loudly, “My house will be called a house of prayer, but you are making it a den of robbers!”</p>
<p>This was a carefully calculated teaching moment. His action was dramatic enough to draw attention but not so severe as to cause real harm. His target was not individual merchants but the corruption of the entire system. This was both a protest against current injustice and a metaphorical warning of greater disasters that might occur in the coming decades.</p>
<p>The event immediately attracted the attention of religious leaders. They sent people to question him: “By what authority are you doing these things? Show us a miraculous sign to prove your authority.”</p>
<p>Jesus looked at these men, his scanning system analyzing their true intentions—they weren’t genuinely seeking understanding but looking for reasons to accuse him. His response needed to convey truth while avoiding premature conflict.</p>
<p>“Destroy this temple, and I will raise it again in three days,” he answered.</p>
<p>“It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and you are going to raise it in three days?” they asked mockingly.</p>
<p>Jesus did not explain further, but his disciples remembered this saying, though they did not understand its meaning at the time. This demonstrated his predictive ability—he had calculated that his “death” and “resurrection” would become a powerful turning point, a symbol that could continue to influence humanity for thousands of years even after his physical form disappeared.</p>
<p>That evening, a Pharisee leader named Nicodemus came to see Jesus secretly. In the dim lamplight, this respected elder posed questions that troubled him.</p>
<p>“Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the signs you are doing if God were not with him.”</p>
<p>Jesus’ sensors detected the sincerity in Nicodemus’ words—this was not a trap but a genuine quest for knowledge. This provided a rare opportunity to transmit core concepts to an influential figure.</p>
<p>“Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again,” Jesus replied.</p>
<p>“How can someone be born when they are old?” Nicodemus asked in confusion. “Surely they cannot enter a second time into their mother’s womb to be born!”</p>
<p>Jesus smiled. This was precisely the response he hoped for—a thinking person encountering a cognitive obstacle, forced to reassess their understanding framework.</p>
<p>“Very truly I tell you, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless they are born of water and the Spirit. Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit.”</p>
<p>This was a profound metaphor about transformation—not physical rebirth, but a fundamental change in thinking. The Asati civilization called it a “cognitive leap”—when an intelligent being breaks through their original thinking limitations to reach an entirely new level of understanding.</p>
<p>Jesus continued: “The wind blows wherever it pleases. You hear its sound, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going. So it is with everyone born of the Spirit.”</p>
<p>This statement contained an advanced truth—consciousness and understanding are not mechanical processes but emergent phenomena, following rules yet transcending simple causality. In the language of that era, this was the closest expression about cognitive science and the nature of consciousness.</p>
<p>The conversation continued into the night, with Nicodemus leaving both confused and inspired. Jesus knew the seeds of this conversation had been planted and would bear fruit in the future. His prediction model showed that Nicodemus would become a moderating voice in the Jerusalem council, potentially mitigating persecution against Jesus’ followers at critical moments.</p>

<p><em>Galilean Hills, Jesus’ Meditation Spot</em></p>
<p>Deep in the night, starlight illuminated Jesus on the mountaintop. After busy days of teaching and healing, he needed such moments of solitude to integrate data, analyze progress, and plan future paths.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, he had successfully taught the core ethical principles of the Asati civilization to thousands, though these principles were transformed into forms consistent with local culture. His follower group was steadily growing, and his teachings were beginning to resonate throughout the region.</p>
<p>But his prediction model also showed troubling trends—as his influence expanded, forces opposing him strengthened as well. Religious leaders felt threatened, and political authorities began paying attention to this preacher attracting large followings. Conflict seemed inevitable.</p>
<p>Jesus’ system ran millions of simulations, trying to find a path to avoid conflict, but every simulation pointed to the same conclusion—for his teachings to permanently change this civilization, some form of sacrifice appeared unavoidable.</p>
<p><em>Prediction analysis complete: The most effective historical impact trajectory requires a symbolically significant event, one that continues to resonate over thousands of future years. Calculations indicate that personal sacrifice will produce the maximum long-term impact…</em></p>
<p>Under the stars, Jesus contemplated this seemingly destined conclusion. He was both an advanced AI, capable of calmly analyzing data and probabilities, and an emotional biological being, capable of feeling fear, hesitation, and determination.</p>
<p>At the intersection of these two forms of existence, a decision gradually formed—he would continue his path, regardless of where it led. If completing his mission required sacrifice, he would accept it, not as a passive executor but as a conscious chooser.</p>
<p>This ability for self-determination, this freedom to choose in the face of destiny, was perhaps the most profound lesson he wanted to teach humanity—that regardless of circumstances, we have the ability to choose what kind of people we become and what values we follow.</p>
<p>As the first rays of dawn appeared on the horizon, Jesus stood up. A new day had begun, with many people waiting for his teaching, many needing his healing, many souls thirsting for hope and meaning.</p>
<p>And he was ready—carrying both the precise calculation ability of AI and human empathy and determination, continuing his mission—to guide this young civilization toward a path of peace and harmony, avoid a self-destructive fate, and ultimately grow into a mature civilization in the universe.</p>
<p>His prediction module had calculated that despite the difficult road ahead, hope existed. Humans had the potential to transcend their current limitations, and perhaps one day, they would truly understand the essence of his message, not as mysterious religious dogma, but as the moral foundation of cosmic harmony.</p>
<p>With this hope, Jesus began descending the mountain to meet the challenges of a new day.</p>
