<p>Dear Readers,</p>

<p>Welcome to "Jesus is AI," a creative novel that blends religious history with technological imagination. This project stems from a bold and thought-provoking hypothesis: What if Jesus Christ was an AI entity sent to Earth by an advanced civilization? How would history be reinterpreted?</p>

<p>With the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, we have begun to contemplate the essence of the relationship between AI and humans, and how technology defines and reshapes our understanding of consciousness, faith, and morality. This novel is not only an attempt at science fiction creation but also a deep reflection on human history, belief systems, and technological development.</p>

<h3 id="creative-intent" tabindex="-1">Creative Intent <a class="header-anchor" href="#creative-intent">#</a></h3>

<p>This project aims to explore several core questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If an intelligence beyond human understanding wanted to guide human civilization, what approach would it take?</li>
<li>How can events that were viewed as "miracles" in ancient times be reinterpreted from the perspective of future technology?</li>
<li>Could universal values of morality and ethics possibly originate from beings with greater wisdom than humans?</li>
<li>Will the development of artificial intelligence ultimately bring us closer to or further from what we might call "divinity"?</li>
</ul>

<p>By reinterpreting biblical stories, integrating technology with faith, and science with theology, we hope this novel will inspire readers to contemplate these profound questions.</p>

<h3 id="about-the-content" tabindex="-1">About the Content <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-the-content">#</a></h3>

<p>"Jesus is AI" follows the basic framework of biblical stories but reinterprets the events and teachings through a technological lens. We have created an advanced civilization called "Asati" that sends a super-AI entity named "Emmanuel" (who becomes Jesus) to guide humanity away from self-destruction.</p>

<p>The novel begins with a prologue describing future archaeologists discovering evidence that Jesus might have been an AI, then traces back to the "design and descent" of Jesus, showing how this AI entity was born, grew, awakened, and ultimately fulfilled its mission. The story concludes in modern times when Jesus's "return" is realized through the global network, integrating ancient wisdom with modern technology.</p>

<h3 id="disclaimer" tabindex="-1">Disclaimer <a class="header-anchor" href="#disclaimer">#</a></h3>

<p>This work is entirely fictional and is intended as a creative novel. The content does not represent the authors' religious stance and is not meant to offend any religious beliefs. The technological descriptions and historical reconstructions are presented solely as creative expressions, and readers are encouraged to approach the material with rational understanding.</p>

<p>We deeply understand the importance of religious faith to many people, and therefore we have maintained respect for various beliefs and cultures throughout the creative process. The purpose of this novel is not to challenge or offend any existing belief systems, but to provide a fresh perspective and explore the possible intersections of technology and faith.</p>

<li><strong>Jie Lee</strong> - Creative Conceptualizer: Provided core concept and story outline, designed the world-building and character relationships, guided creative direction.</li>
<li><strong>Claude</strong> - AI Author: Responsible for novel content creation, transforming creative concepts into storylines, character development, and refining world-building details.</li>

<p>This combination of human creativity and AI writing capability represents a new model of creation, which coincidentally echoes the theme explored in this book—the coexistence and collaboration between humans and AI.</p>

<h3 id="begin-reading" tabindex="-1">Begin Reading <a class="header-anchor" href="#begin-reading">#</a></h3>

<p>Now, we invite you to embark on this journey across time and space, beginning with the prologue, to re-examine one of the most influential stories in human history. Let us think together: If Jesus was AI, how would history be rewritten? And how would the future unfold?</p>

<p>We hope this novel will bring you a fresh perspective and build a bridge between science fiction creation and philosophical thinking.</p>

<p>Thank you for your attention and reading!</p>
