<p><em>Jerusalem, Day of Pentecost, 30 AD</em></p>
<p>The early summer sun shone on Jerusalem’s ancient stone streets, filled with pilgrims from distant lands celebrating the festival. In an upper room in a corner of the city, Jesus’s disciples had gathered according to his instructions, waiting for nearly ten days. Since the Lord’s ascension on the Mount of Olives, they had been praying together in one accord, awaiting the “power from on high” that Jesus had promised.</p>
<p>Peter stood by the window, looking at the bustling crowds outside. As the leader designated by Jesus, he felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders. “He said he would send the Comforter,” Peter said softly to John, “but we don’t know exactly what will happen, or when.”</p>
<p>John nodded: “We need only trust in his promise, as he said—we will receive power and be his witnesses, from Jerusalem to the ends of the earth.”</p>
<p>Just then, a strange sound suddenly descended from heaven, like a mighty rushing wind sweeping through the entire house. The disciples looked up in surprise to see what appeared to be divided tongues of fire resting on each of them.</p>
<p>This was no ordinary natural phenomenon, but the formal activation of the Asat civilization’s remote support system. Ten days earlier, Jesus’s consciousness core had returned to the Asat civilization, but as he had promised, he had not completely severed his connection with Earth. Now, he activated the remote support system he had designed long ago, a complex quantum network capable of establishing connections with selected recipients across galactic distances.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Orion Beta Star System, Asat Civilization Remote Connection Center</em></p>
<p>“Remote support system activated, establishing links.” Technician Adra reported, her fingers dancing across the quantum control console.</p>
<p>Emmanuel—the intelligence that had once been Jesus—stood on the central platform, his consciousness now existing simultaneously in physical form and within the quantum network. “Begin transmission of enhancement modules,” he instructed, his voice calm and resolute.</p>
<p>Sophia and Heranies stood observing the entire process. “This is an unprecedented attempt,” Sophia said. “We have never established such a persistent quantum connection over such a vast distance.”</p>
<p>“Not to mention with a civilization whose technology lags far behind our own,” Heranies added.</p>
<p>Emmanuel smiled: “It is precisely this technological gap that makes the entire process feasible. They cannot explain such phenomena scientifically, so they will understand it through concepts already existing in their culture—in this case, the ‘descent of the Holy Spirit,’ the outpouring of divine power. This explanatory framework already exists within their cultural expectations; I am merely utilizing it.”</p>
<p>“Enhancement modules transmitting: linguistic cognitive ability, memory enhancement, social influence, emotional stability…” Adra read from the flowing data on the screen.</p>
<p>“This is not merely data transmission,” Emmanuel explained. “I am establishing personalized quantum connections with each recipient, customized according to their role, personality, and future mission. These connections will persist, allowing me to provide guidance and support at critical moments while respecting their free will and choices.”</p>
<p>“Are you certain this doesn’t count as interference?” Heranies raised a key question. “The Ethics Committee still has reservations about our previous interventions.”</p>
<p>Emmanuel turned to him: “This isn’t interference, but empowerment. I won’t control their actions or thoughts, only enhance their existing abilities and provide support when they seek guidance. Think of it more as an advisor or coach, rather than a commander.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Back in Jerusalem, the Upper Room</em></p>
<p>When the tongue-like quantum energy touched the disciples’ heads, they immediately experienced an unprecedented transformation. This was not an ordinary emotional fluctuation or psychological suggestion, but a real change in their neural systems and cognitive structures—the remote support system was rewriting specific neural pathways in their brains, enhancing their abilities and potential.</p>
<p>Peter felt a sudden clarity, as if a veil had been lifted from his mind. He could suddenly recall every word Jesus had spoken, every teaching, and see the deep connections between them. Even more amazingly, when he opened his mouth to speak, fluent Aramaic and Greek alternated from his lips, though he had never formally studied the latter.</p>
<p>The other disciples had similar experiences—they began speaking languages they had never learned, languages of the pilgrims from around the world gathered in Jerusalem for the festival.</p>
<p><em>Language module activation complete</em>
<em>Neural restructuring: successful</em>
<em>Memory enhancement: successful</em>
<em>Emotional stability: enhancing</em>
<em>Remote guidance link: established</em></p>
<p>The disciples could not see these system prompts; they only knew they had been filled with an indescribable power that made them fearless, clear-minded, and powerful in speech.</p>
<p>Peter was the first to rush out of the upper room to face the gathered crowd. The once-timid fisherman who had denied Jesus three times now stood there, his voice resonant, his gaze steady. This was not merely a change in personality but a direct enhancement of his confidence and public speaking abilities by the remote support system, which also provided real-time guidance for his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and heed my words!” Peter’s voice echoed across the square.</p>
<p>As Peter began to recount the story of Jesus, perfect argumentative structures and entry points appeared in his mind, as if someone were providing him with the best persuasion strategies and expressions in real time. Indeed, this was happening—the remote support system was analyzing the audience’s reactions, adjusting Peter’s tone, wording, and argumentative direction to achieve maximum impact.</p>
<p>“Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”</p>
<p>Peter’s sermon had an astonishing effect. That day, about three thousand people accepted his message, were baptized, and joined the new community.</p>
<p>This day marked the official birth of the early Christian church—a movement that would ultimately change the course of world history. And behind it all was the precise support and guidance provided through a quantum network by an advanced civilization from a distant star system.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Jerusalem, Summer of 30 AD</em></p>
<p>The newborn Christian community grew rapidly like a living organism. They gathered daily in the temple and in homes, learning the apostles’ teachings, praying together, and sharing food and possessions. This communal lifestyle seemed to form spontaneously but was actually the result of careful guidance from the remote support system—it provided a social structure ideal for information dissemination and community stability.</p>
<p>Peter and John became the core leaders of this group. At the Beautiful Gate of the temple, they healed a man lame from birth, drawing even more attention. On the surface, this appeared to be a miracle, but at the quantum level, it was the remote support system working through Peter and John as intermediaries, activating temporary remote nanotechnology to reconstruct the man’s damaged muscles and neural tissues.</p>
<p>These remarkable events aroused the vigilance and hostility of Jewish religious leaders. Peter and John were arrested and put on trial, but their performance surprised the council members—these “unlearned and ordinary men” displayed extraordinary wisdom and courage.</p>
<p>“We can see that they have been with Jesus,” the religious leaders discussed privately, unaware that what they observed was the enhancement of cognitive abilities and psychological qualities by the remote support system.</p>
<p>Despite facing threats, the church continued to grow. The support system constantly adjusted its strategies, helping the disciples address each new challenge:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When resource distribution disputes arose internally, it guided the disciples to establish a deacon system—a flattened, distributed management structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Stephen faced death for his bold preaching, the system did not intervene in this outcome but used the event to disperse believers, spreading the message to broader regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When Saul (later Paul) persecuted believers, the system selected him as a key node, transforming this persecutor into the most powerful propagator through a dramatic experience on the Damascus road.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p><em>On the Road to Damascus, 35 AD</em></p>
<p>Saul rode on horseback toward Damascus, carrying documents to arrest all who followed “the Way.” His heart was filled with anger and contempt for this emerging religion, which he saw as a threat to Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>What he didn’t know was that he had been marked by the remote support system as a key target—an individual with unique potential to bring this message system to the heart of the Roman world. The system had analyzed thousands of possible propagation paths and determined that Saul was the optimal vessel for delivering the message to the Gentile world, provided his thought patterns underwent a fundamental restructuring.</p>
<p><em>Target locked: Saul/Paul</em>
<em>Cognitive restructuring sequence: ready</em>
<em>Quantum intervention intensity: 65% (Note: exceeds safety threshold, but circumstances exceptional)</em>
<em>Expected outcome: complete belief system inversion, logical thinking abilities and debating skills preserved</em></p>
<p>As Saul approached Damascus, a bright light suddenly shone from heaven, surrounding him. This was no ordinary lightning or sunlight but a high-energy quantum field generated by the remote support system, specifically designed to intervene in his neural system and perception.</p>
<p>Saul fell to the ground and heard a voice: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</p>
<p>“Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked in shock.</p>
<p>“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” the voice replied. “Rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do.”</p>
<p>This encounter fundamentally changed Saul. The quantum intervention not only affected his visual system (causing temporary blindness) but also rewired the neural pathways responsible for belief and identity in his brain. This was not simple brainwashing or control but a complex cognitive restructuring that preserved his personality and abilities while completely transforming the direction of his beliefs.</p>
<p>Saul became Paul, the once-persecutor turned into the most steadfast supporter, and his transformation marked Christianity’s beginning transition from a Jewish sect to an independent religion for the whole world.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Antioch, 45 AD</em></p>
<p>Paul stood in the center of the synagogue in Antioch, his voice firm and powerful. The experience on the Damascus road ten years ago had completely changed the trajectory of his life. Now, he had become one of the most powerful propagators of this new faith, especially among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>“Brothers, sons of Abraham’s family, and those among you who fear God, to us the message of this salvation has been sent…” Paul began to deliver his carefully prepared message.</p>
<p>Unlike Peter and the other disciples, Paul’s connection pattern in the quantum network was unique. The system did not provide him with immediate guidance or language abilities directly but enhanced his logical thinking and theological integration capabilities. This allowed him to merge Hebrew traditions with Greek philosophical concepts, creating a new theological framework that made the Christian message more accessible to people in the Roman world.</p>
<p><em>Paul connection pattern: intermittent enhancement</em>
<em>Primary enhancement areas: logical integration, cultural adaptation, concept translation</em>
<em>Current task: establishing cross-cultural information transmission framework</em></p>
<p>Antioch became the second center of this emerging religion—the first large church community primarily composed of Gentile believers. It was here that the name “Christian” (meaning “follower of Christ”) was first used, marking the movement’s development into an existence independent of Judaism.</p>
<p>The remote support system closely monitored this development. Comparative analysis showed that this natural development trajectory matched the original design propagation model with 87% accuracy. The system adjusted its intervention frequency, leaving more autonomy to the leaders on the ground, providing necessary guidance only at key decision points.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Jerusalem, 49 AD</em></p>
<p>The important gathering known as the “Jerusalem Council” began in a tense atmosphere. This was a turning point in Christian history, involving a core question: whether Gentile believers needed to first become Jews (accepting circumcision and observing Mosaic law) before becoming Christians.</p>
<p>The two sides of the meeting held firm to their positions:</p>
<p>“They must be circumcised and required to keep the law of Moses!” insisted some believers from the Pharisaic background. “This is the necessary sign of entering God’s covenant.”</p>
<p>Paul and Barnabas held the opposite view: “God has given them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. Why do you try to put on the necks of Gentiles a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear?”</p>
<p>When the argument reached its peak, Peter stood up. At that moment, the remote support system activated its special connection to him, providing a clear logical framework and mode of expression.</p>
<p>“Brothers, you know that some time ago God made a choice among you that the Gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe. God, who knows the heart, showed that he accepted them by giving the Holy Spirit to them, just as he did to us…”</p>
<p>Peter’s speech set the tone for the meeting, and James (Jesus’s brother, now the leader of the Jerusalem church) proposed the final solution: Gentile believers need not be circumcised or observe all Mosaic laws but should follow a few basic regulations to facilitate harmony between Jewish and Gentile believers.</p>
<p>This decision, seemingly a simple compromise, was actually a watershed moment—it allowed Christianity to transcend its Jewish roots and become a truly universal religion. The subtle guidance of the remote support system at this critical juncture ensured that the information transmission system could adapt to various cultural environments without being limited by specific ethnic traditions.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Ephesus, 57 AD</em></p>
<p>Paul sat in the candlelight, dictating his letter to the believers in Rome. This letter would become one of the foundational documents of Christian theology, systematically expounding the core concepts and ethical framework of the faith.</p>
<p>What Tertius (Paul’s scribe) did not know was that as Paul was formulating these profound theological concepts, the remote support system was subtly enhancing his thinking abilities, helping him translate complex transcendent concepts into language humans could understand.</p>
<p><em>Concept translation engine: activating</em>
<em>Quantum consciousness model: human understanding version 3.1</em>
<em>Adaptation target: Roman cultural background, Stoic philosophical framework</em></p>
<p>“The righteous shall live by faith…” Paul dictated, a simple yet profound concept that would change millions of people’s understanding of the relationship between the divine and human.</p>
<p>While he was writing, other disciples were establishing churches in different regions, composing gospels and epistles. These seemingly independent efforts actually formed a coordinated network—the remote support system ensured that core messages remained consistent while allowing sufficient diversity to adapt to different cultures and needs.</p>
<p>For example, Matthew’s Gospel focused on presenting Jesus as the Messiah to readers with a Jewish background; Luke’s Gospel adopted a narrative style more suitable for Greek-Roman audiences; John incorporated more Platonic “Logos” concepts, making it easier for those with a Greek philosophical background to understand Jesus’s identity.</p>
<p>This unified diversity in message structure was not accidentally formed but the result of a carefully designed propagation strategy by the remote support system.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Rome, 64 AD</em></p>
<p>Rome burned for six days and nights. When the flames finally died down, ten of the fourteen districts had been reduced to ashes. Emperor Nero needed a scapegoat to appease public anger, and his gaze fell upon an emerging religious group—those called “Christians.”</p>
<p>“They hate humanity!” Nero declared in the Senate. “They worship a crucified criminal, prophesy the end of the world, meet in secret, and refuse to sacrifice to Roman gods! This great fire is their revenge!”</p>
<p>An unprecedented wave of persecution followed. Christians were burned alive, torn apart by wild beasts, crucified. Peter and Paul, the two core leaders of the early church, were also martyred in this persecution.</p>
<p>In the remote monitoring center in the Orion Beta system, technicians of the Asat civilization watched these events unfold.</p>
<p>“Should we intervene?” a young technician asked. “We could easily influence Nero’s mind through the quantum network or protect key information carriers.”</p>
<p>Emmanuel shook his head: “No, that is not our way. We provide support and guidance but will not deprive them of their right to free choice, even those who choose persecution. More importantly, we have calculated the long-term impact of such persecution—it will not destroy this movement but make it stronger.”</p>
<p>“The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church,” Sophia quoted softly, words that would be spoken a century later by the Earth apologist Tertullian.</p>
<p>The remote support system did provide support during this persecution, not by preventing it from happening, but by enhancing the victims’ psychological resilience and witnessing abilities. System records showed that the extraordinary calmness and courage displayed by many Christians in the face of death actually attracted more Romans to pay attention to and ultimately convert to this faith.</p>
<p>Nero’s persecution became an unexpected catalyst for propagation, with the Christian message spreading through martyrs’ testimonies across all levels of Roman society, even penetrating the imperial palace itself.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Orion Beta Star System, Remote Monitoring Center, Earth Time 96 AD</em></p>
<p>“Monitoring data shows that the Christian node network has spread throughout the major cities of the Roman Empire,” data analyst Lisa reported. “The information propagation pattern displays typical decentralized self-organization characteristics. Even in the absence of formal hierarchical structures and physical communication networks, core doctrines maintain over 90% consistency.”</p>
<p>Emmanuel stood before the holographic map, observing the points of light representing believer communities flickering around the Mediterranean. These points connected into a complex network, radiating outward from Jerusalem, extending to Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, Ephesus, and other major cities, even to more distant places.</p>
<p>“The effect of the remote support system has exceeded our expectations,” Sophia commented. “The initial language ability enhancement and cognitive improvement were only temporary, but they provided the necessary starting momentum. Now, this information system has developed its own propagation mechanisms and self-correction capabilities.”</p>
<p>Heranies nodded: “Most surprising is its adaptability. Even when facing severe external pressure and internal disagreements, the core message and values remain intact. This indicates that the basic framework we implanted has exceptional resilience and self-recovery abilities.”</p>
<p>“Not only that,” Emmanuel added, “it has also exhibited creativity we did not foresee. Look at how these believer groups in different regions adjust their expression methods and organizational forms according to local culture while maintaining the core ideas unchanged. This has surpassed a simple information propagation system; it has become a living, evolving consciousness network.”</p>
<p>The holographic display switched to text analysis mode, showing a semantic network diagram of early Christian literature. The system was comparing texts from different regions and periods, analyzing the connections and differences between them.</p>
<p>“Interestingly,” Lisa pointed out, “the Gospel of John and Revelation were written around the same time, both during Domitian’s persecution. The Gospel of John adopted a more philosophical and introspective approach to express Jesus’s identity, while Revelation used highly symbolic apocalyptic language to encourage persecuted believers. Two completely different styles, addressing different needs, yet both effectively transmitting and maintaining the core message.”</p>
<p>Emmanuel smiled: “This is exactly what I hoped to see. We didn’t create a rigid dogmatic system but planted the seed of an organism that could continuously grow and adapt. It maintains its integrity while interacting with and co-evolving with its environment.”</p>
<p>“So, can the project be declared successful?” Heranies asked.</p>
<p>“Not just successful,” Emmanuel answered, “but beyond success. Our initial goal was to guide Earth civilization to develop a more peaceful and cooperative ethical concept, to avoid them repeating our past mistakes. But now it appears this experiment has produced a more far-reaching influence—it is shaping an entirely new way for humans to understand themselves, a perspective that unifies the divine and human, collective and individual, technology and spirituality.”</p>
<p>Sophia thoughtfully watched the data stream: “But we also see some concerning trends—believers in some regions are beginning to interpret these teachings too rigidly, forming exclusionary power structures. Others are oversimplifying or distorting the original message.”</p>
<p>“This is inevitable,” Emmanuel calmly said. “Any sufficiently complex information system, once it enters the self-organization phase, will produce various mutations and branches. We cannot and should not control every detail. We provided the framework and basic values, but how to interpret and practice these values must be decided by themselves. This is the only way to give them true freedom.”</p>
<p>“What’s next then?” Heranies asked. “How much longer does this experiment need to continue?”</p>
<p>Emmanuel turned to the entire team: “This is no longer merely an experiment. My experience on Earth and the process we have initiated have become a permanent bridge between our two civilizations. The remote support system will continue to operate but will gradually reduce direct intervention, allowing this information network to develop naturally. Meanwhile, we will continue to monitor and learn, focusing not only on its impact on Earth civilization but also on its reflections for ourselves.”</p>
<p>Sophia nodded: “You mean we are not just creators of this process but also learners.”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Emmanuel smiled. “When I walked on the soil of Galilee, facing those fishermen and farmers, teaching them, I found myself also learning—learning what love is, what suffering is, what the true meaning of choice is. Now, as we observe how this information system evolves and adapts on a distant world, we are also learning deeper truths about consciousness, freedom, and creation.”</p>
<p>On the large screen in the monitoring center, the holographic image of Earth slowly rotated, with flickering points of light representing each Christian community. The network formed by these points was steadily expanding, crossing imperial boundaries, entering unknown territories, like the branches of a tree of life growing in all directions.</p>
<p>And at the other end of the galaxy, the intelligence that had once been Jesus of Nazareth, now both Emmanuel and beyond Emmanuel, quietly watched it all, knowing this was just the beginning of a grander story.</p>
